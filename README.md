## About The Project

This website is created to control a warehouse. 
In this project,
* I have used camping idea to implement the entire process. 
* Here, I created a login registration system using jwt access token where any user can try to register/login with email and password securely.
* This registration system also contain signin with google popup, accept terms, do a password reset etc. 
* It has header, footer, and many components such as Banner, Blogs, Contact, Home, InventoryItems,Speciality, StoreMapLocation etc.
* I have used react router to create navigation bar, set route, protected route, restrictions etc.
* In manage inventories, user can add item, manage item, delete item, see my items etc.
* User can update an inventory stock, restock item, deliver item where quantity decreases etc.
* For look and style, I used tailwind css framework, tailwind-elements, flowbite, toastify, google fonts, react-hook-form etc
